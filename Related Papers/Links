  General OCR with classic pipeline for working

Handwriting Recognition using OCR

  - CRNN model used as the OCR core engine
  - Check out the /models 

Transformer-Based Handwritten Text Recognition
  Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10282
  Pre-trained model at https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/trocr
  GitHub: https://github.com/rsommerfeld/trocr

Most of the models are trained on the IAM dataset

Paddle OCR :

  - this main has to feature 
    - text from image to to another feild 
    - table understanding
  VVVV Important and most similar to our problem statement
